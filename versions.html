      <h2><a href="#" name="perr">Little Red Riding Hood</a></h2>
      <h4>By: Charles Perrault</h4>
      <p>
        Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.
        One day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, "Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter." </p>

        <p>Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village. </p>

        <p>As she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, "I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother."</p>

        <p>"Does she live far off?" said the wolf</p>

        <p>"Oh I say," answered Little Red Riding Hood; "it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village." </p>

        <p>"Well," said the wolf, "and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first."</p>

        <p>The wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.</p>

        <p>"Who's there?"</p>

        <p>"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood," replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; "who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother."</p>

        <p>The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, "Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."</p>

        <p>The wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.</p>

        <p>"Who's there?"</p>

        <p>Little Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, "It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you."</p>

        <p>The wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, "Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."</p>

        <p>Little Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.<p>

          <p>The wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, "Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me."</p>

          <p>Little Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, "Grandmother, what big arms you have!"</p>

          <p>"All the better to hug you with, my dear."</p>

          <p>"Grandmother, what big legs you have!"</p>

          <p>"All the better to run with, my child."</p>

          <p>"Grandmother, what big ears you have!"</p>

          <p>"All the better to hear with, my child."</p>

          <p>"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!"</p>

          <p>"All the better to see with, my child."</p>

          <p>"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!"</p>

          <p>"All the better to eat you up with."</p>

          <p>And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.</p>

          <h2><a href="#" name="grimm">Little Red Cap</a></h2>
          <h4>By: Brother's Grimm (Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm)</h4>
          <p> Once upon a time there was a sweet little girl. Everyone who saw her liked her, but most of all her grandmother, who did not know what to give the child next. Once she gave her a little cap made of red velvet. Because it suited her so well, and she wanted to wear it all the time, she came to be known as Little Red Cap.</p>
          <p>One day her mother said to her, "Come Little Red Cap. Here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother. She is sick and weak, and they will do her well. Mind your manners and give her my greetings. Behave yourself on the way, and do not leave the path, or you might fall down and break the glass, and then there will be nothing for your sick grandmother."</p>

          <p>Little Red Cap promised to obey her mother. The grandmother lived out in the woods, a half hour from the village. When Little Red Cap entered the woods a wolf came up to her. She did not know what a wicked animal he was, and was not afraid of him.</p>

          <p>"Good day to you, Little Red Cap."</p>

          <p>"Thank you, wolf."</p>

          <p>"Where are you going so early, Little Red Cap?"</p>

          <p>"To grandmother's."</p>

          <p>"And what are you carrying under your apron?"</p>

          <p>"Grandmother is sick and weak, and I am taking her some cake and wine. We baked yesterday, and they should give her strength."</p>

          <p>"Little Red Cap, just where does your grandmother live?"

            <p>"Her house is a good quarter hour from here in the woods, under the three large oak trees. There's a hedge of hazel bushes there. You must know the place," said Little Red Cap.</p>

            <p>The wolf thought to himself, "Now there is a tasty bite for me. Just how are you going to catch her?" Then he said, "Listen, Little Red Cap, haven't you seen the beautiful flowers that are blossoming in the woods? Why don't you go and take a look? And I don't believe you can hear how beautifully the birds are singing. You are walking along as though you were on your way to school in the village. It is very beautiful in the woods."</p>

            <p>Little Red Cap opened her eyes and saw the sunlight breaking through the trees and how the ground was covered with beautiful flowers. She thought, "If a take a bouquet to grandmother, she will be very pleased. Anyway, it is still early, and I'll be home on time." And she ran off into the woods looking for flowers. Each time she picked one she thought that she could see an even more beautiful one a little way off, and she ran after it, going further and further into the woods. But the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked on the door.</p>

            <p>"Who's there?"</p>

            <p>"Little Red Cap. I'm bringing you some cake and wine. Open the door for me."</p>

            <p>"Just press the latch," called out the grandmother. "I'm too weak to get up."</p>

            <p>The wolf pressed the latch, and the door opened. He stepped inside, went straight to the grandmother's bed, and ate her up. Then he took her clothes, put them on, and put her cap on his head. He got into her bed and pulled the curtains shut.</p>

            <p>Little Red Cap had run after flowers, and did not continue on her way to grandmother's until she had gathered all that she could carry. When she arrived, she found, to her surprise, that the door was open. She walked into the parlor, and everything looked so strange that she thought, "Oh, my God, why am I so afraid? I usually like it at grandmother's." Then she went to the bed and pulled back the curtains. Grandmother was lying there with her cap pulled down over her face and looking very strange.</p>

            <p>"Oh, grandmother, what big ears you have!"</p>

            <p>"All the better to hear you with."</p>

            <p>"Oh, grandmother, what big eyes you have!"</p>

            <p>"All the better to see you with."</p>

            <p>"Oh, grandmother, what big hands you have!"</p>

            <p>"All the better to grab you with!"</p>

            <p>"Oh, grandmother, what a horribly big mouth you have!"</p>

            <p>"All the better to eat you with!" And with that he jumped out of bed, jumped on top of poor Little Red Cap, and ate her up. As soon as the wolf had finished this tasty bite, he climbed back into bed, fell asleep, and began to snore very loudly.</p>

            <p>A huntsman was just passing by. He thought it strange that the old woman was snoring so loudly, so he decided to take a look. He stepped inside, and in the bed there lay the wolf that he had been hunting for such a long time. "He has eaten the grandmother, but perhaps she still can be saved. I won't shoot him," thought the huntsman. So he took a pair of scissors and cut open his belly.</p>

            <p>He had cut only a few strokes when he saw the red cap shining through. He cut a little more, and the girl jumped out and cried, "Oh, I was so frightened! It was so dark inside the wolf's body!"</p>

            <p>And then the grandmother came out alive as well. Then Little Red Cap fetched some large heavy stones. They filled the wolf's body with them, and when he woke up and tried to run away, the stones were so heavy that he fell down dead.</p>

            <p>The three of them were happy. The huntsman took the wolf's pelt. The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine that Little Red Cap had brought. And Little Red Cap thought to herself, "As long as I live, I will never leave the path and run off into the woods by myself if mother tells me not to."</p>

            <p>They also tell how Little Red Cap was taking some baked things to her grandmother another time, when another wolf spoke to her and wanted her to leave the path. But Little Red Cap took care and went straight to grandmother's. She told her that she had seen the wolf, and that he had wished her a good day, but had stared at her in a wicked manner. "If we hadn't been on a public road, he would have eaten me up," she said.</p>

            <p>"Come," said the grandmother. "Let's lock the door, so he can't get in."</p>

            <p>Soon afterward the wolf knocked on the door and called out, "Open up, grandmother. It's Little Red Cap, and I'm bringing you some baked things."</p>

            <p>They remained silent, and did not open the door. The wicked one walked around the house several times, and finally jumped onto the roof. He wanted to wait until Little Red Cap went home that evening, then follow her and eat her up in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what he was up to. There was a large stone trough in front of the house.</p>

            <p>"Fetch a bucket, Little Red Cap," she said. "Yesterday I cooked some sausage. Carry the water that I boiled them with to the trough." Little Red Cap carried water until the large, large trough was clear full. The smell of sausage arose into the wolf's nose. He sniffed and looked down, stretching his neck so long that he could no longer hold himself, and he began to slide. He slid off the roof, fell into the trough, and drowned. And Little Red Cap returned home happily and safely.</p>

            <p>I’m with the camp out there that opposes books being banned for any reason. I believe that if you’re not OK with your children reading a certain book then that’s up to you but parents shouldn’t be trying to create restrictions for kids other than their own.
            </p>

            <p>That being said, I strongly disagree with the reasons why Little Red Riding Hood was once a banned book. Let’s breakdown the arguments:

              Alcohol: First, to a child there’s nothing suggestive about a bottle containing some liquids. Children who’ve not yet been exposed to wine would not think twice about a brief image in the story. These parents are too closely analyzing something that the average child would never pickup on. I know this from experience because I read the fairytale as a child myself but it wash’t until recently researching the controversy behind it that this aspect of the wine was brought to my attention.
            </p>

            <p>To paraphrase… 
              “Once upon a time, people drank nothing but wine and beer because water was often unsafe. Jesus took perfectly healthy water and turned it into wine. People drink wine in communion, and wine is openly for sale at the grocery store. People in movies & television have wine at dinner, there are wine lists sitting on the table at restaurants and doctors often publicly tout the benefits of red wine. Did I mention that the Bible says ’drink wine, it's good for your stomachs?’ Yet, the depiction of a fairy tale Grandmother drinking wine is perceived as a plot to turn kids into alcoholics. Whoever heard of a Grandmother who was under 21?” - <a href="http://dangerouspages.blogspot.com/2009/06/banned-book-little-red-riding-hood.html" target="blank">Dangerous Pages</a>
            </p>

            <p>Violence:
              Now the aspect of violence is one I can see someone mounting an argument against. But let’s revisit the argument: “The wolf’s actions were too violent.” When have we ever considered the actions of wild animals to be non-violent. It should be universal knowledge that wolves eat can and will eat humans if we’re being honest. So I don’t see this fairy tale as being anything other than holding true to nature.
